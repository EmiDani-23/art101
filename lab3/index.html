					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges I've expirienced in this lab is figuring out which HTML file I needed, where to put information and what was needed to put in the files.  </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I wasnt quite sure of what the assigment was asking for and I was very confused. However I went back and re-read the assignment a few times, everything became clearer and I was able to complete Lab 3. </p>
