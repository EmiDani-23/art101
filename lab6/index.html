			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>little to no problems came up, this lab was very sraight forward and any questions I had on where code needed to go or what I needed to do that I didn't understand from the assignmnet wen't to WesBot or my partner Angel.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Though Lab 6 was really straight foward it was really easy to forget some of the details within the codes, in one instance I wrote console wrong and I was confused for a while before I realized. Thanks to my partner and Wesbot the Lab went by without much more of a hitch after,  </p>
