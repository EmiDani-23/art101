					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 9 was for us to create an HTML, CSS and JS file for Lab 9 from scratch and to create a Javascript file using jQuery. </p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had slight problems fguring out the jQuery and Javascript, I asked my partner as well as Wesbot to clarify, aid and look over my code for any mistakes.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>  Overall Lab 9 has been pretty straight forward, minus the few hiccups and confusions I had with the jQuery the lab went well.  </p>
