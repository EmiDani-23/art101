					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The lab was decently sraight forward, however It took me a minute because I wasnt aware i did it correctly at first and assumed it just wasnt working so i kept changing it until my partner brought it to my attention. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I had some mistakes in Lab 32 that I fixed and I would say the lab is decently sraight forward. </p>
