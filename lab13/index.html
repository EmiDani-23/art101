					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Lab 13 asked us to make a JS string so some numbers and words come ot with them, it was slightly confusing as I did it correctly the first time but didnt realize.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The lab was decently sraight forward, however It took me a minute because I wasnt aware i did it correctly at first and assumed it just wasnt working so i kept changing it until my partner brought it to my attention. </p>
			</div>		

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I had some mistakes in Lab 32 that I fixed and I would say the lab is decently sraight forward. </p>
