			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Lab 4 was more about Pseudocoding and makig lists and breaking things down into steps in order to pave ur way to using JavaScript. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had little to no problem with the beggining steps of the lab but the last step was very confusing to me. I asked my partner Angel a lot of questions about this lab and she was able to help me clear it up.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Lab 4 was prety straight forward for the most part and I was able to create a pasic step by step Pseudocode for the game Chess, and 'How to change your car tire'. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> My Pseudocode: </p>
			<div class="pseudocode"> 
				<pre><code>
//Print the board before each turn
//The end goal is to take the other players' king
//Allow non-computer players to choose between white or black chess pieces 
//Whoever has the white chess pieces does their first move
//Accept user input in accordance with the  chess piece 
	//King: Moves one square in any direction.
	//Queen: Moves any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
	//Rook: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
	//Bishop: Moves any number of squares diagonally.
	//Knight: Moves in an ‘L-shape,’ two squares in a straight direction, and then one square perpendicular to that.
	 //Pawn: Moves one square forward, but it can move two squares forward on its first move. 
	         It captures diagonally one square forward. They cannot move backward. 
//Validate user move
//Evaluate possible moves
//Choose a computer move in accordance with chess pieces and their moves
//Whichever player captures the other player's king wins the game.
