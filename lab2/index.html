			<h1>Hello World!</h1>
			<p>My Name is Emily Barete, I am a second year AGPM and Art double major. I have little to no coding expirience (Leaning towards no), but i'm very excited to be here and am enjoying it so far! My partner Angel is an incredibly kind and generous person, who has otherworldy talent in art. We both love art and are very creative!</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The chalenge of this lab was trying to understand how to use CSS and HTML as someone who has no expirience with either. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didnt know what to fill in where untill I saw the h2 sections in the coding algorithm and undrestood from there.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this assignmnet was straightforward. The HTML was straight forwards and understandable. The CSS was confusing and I had to ask Angel for help. Overall, I believe I did good on this assignment for being a beginner and put in as much effort as I knew how to do.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I was able to change the labs appearance ranging from color to font, font size and more through CSS. CSS was a bit confusing however with help from my partner I now understand it better.</p>
